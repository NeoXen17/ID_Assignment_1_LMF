Project Name:
Lee Ming Feng's Personal Portfolio Site

---Design Process:
This website is intended for potential and future employers to look at when they are considering me for headhunting. My website presents some facts about my personality, my skillset and education history that may be suitable for the job role. It also showcases my work experience and projects which may be useful for those who are looking for someone who has work experience. This may also be for employers who are looking for valuable contributors for their own projects. I have also added a contact page to allow potential employers to contact me for informal or formal interviews or more information about me, my work experience and projects. It can also make networking easier as others can connect with me easily through the form or social media.

---User Stories:
-As a potential employer, I would enter the site and navigate through all the tabs and view all the information about the potential employee; Lee Ming Feng
-As another employee in the same industry that I am working in, they can go to contact section to message me by using the form or by clicking on the social media icons to connect with me.

-Add screen overlay effects amd modals for certain images such as certificate to enable zoom-in views

Technologies and Tools Used in the project:
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Used to code the structure and content of the website
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - Used to code the presentation and visual interaction of the website to make it more visually appealing
3. JS (JavaScript) - Used to code user interaction, slideshows, events and change classes for elements
4. VS Code (Visual Studio Code) - Used to code all the html, css and js for the website
5. Github - Used for source control to restore previous versions and commit new ones to the repository by connecting it with VS Code

Testing:
1. Navigation Bar:
   1. Hovering over the tabs on the navigation bar produces overlay effects
   2. Clicking on the tabs redirects the user to a different page
   3. Current page is shown on the right side of the navigation bar

2. Manual Slideshow:
   1. Go to "My Education History" page
   2. Try to interact with the slideshow by pressing at the arrow keys at the left and right edges of the slideshow section
   3. Try to interact with the slideshow by pressing at the buttons at the bottom of the slideshow section
   
3. Contact form:
   1. Go to "My Contacts" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

4. Clickable Images:
   1. Clicking on the image should open an external site
   2. Hovering over certain images would have an overlay effect or transition

5. Media Queries:
   1. Normal Laptop Screen of (1920 x 1080)px shows all content without overlapping with the exception of the dropdown box 
   2. Resizing the screen to 576px causes content elements (excluding navigation bars, slideshows and headers) to display in a column format
